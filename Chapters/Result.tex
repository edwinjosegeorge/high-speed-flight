\chapter{Experimental Results}

High-speed flight in the wild is very challenging because of their complex structure (e.g. thick vegetation, thin branches, or collapsed walls) and multiple options available to avoid obstacles. In addition, a high-level understanding of the environment is necessary, which is worsened by challenging illumination conditions and low texture surfaces (e.g. because of snow). 

The experiments in simulation show that the proposed approach reduces the failure rate up to 10 times with respect to state-of-the-art methods. The results are confirmed by testing in a variety of real-world environments using a custom-built physical quadrotor;
deploying the policytrained in simulation without any further adaptations. 

\section{Environmental Setup}

In all experiments conducted, the drone was provided with a reference trajectory to encode the intendedflight path. The trajectories are not collision-free and would lead to a crash into obstacles if blindly executed. This reference can be provided by a user or a higher-level planning algorithm. The drone is tasked to follow that flight path and make adjustments as necessary to avoid obstacles. 

The performance is measured according to success rate, i.e. the percentage of successful runs over the total number of runs, where we considera run successful if the drone reaches the goal location within a radiusof 5 m without crashing. 

\subsection{Natural environment}
Experiments are performed in diverse natural environments as shown in figure \ref{fig:natural envt}. The experiment were performed in two different reference trajectories:a 40 m-long straight line and a circle with a 6 m radius. The quadrotor was flown in a straight line atdifferent average speeds in the range of 3 to 10 $m/s$. A total of 31 experiments were conducted in natural environments.

\subsection{Human-made environments}
In these environments, the dronefaces a different set of challenges. It has to avoid obstacles witha variety of sizes and shapes as shown in figure \ref{fig:human envt}. The irregularand/or large structure of the encountered obstacles, the limited numberof flyable openings, and the requirement to initiate the avoidancemaneuver well in advance, offer a complementary set of challenges.

\textbf{Narrow gap test}\\
Here the drones are required to exit a hangar by passing through a narrow gap of about 0.8 m in width. At the start of the experiment, the drones are placed at about 10 m in front of and about 5 mto the right of the gap. The task was represented by a straight referencetrajectory passing through a wall. This experiment is challenging since it requires a high-level understanding of theenvironment to turn early enough toward the gap. 

\subsection{Controlled experiments}
A set of controlled experiments in simulation was conducted to comparethe performance of the model with several baselines. Two representative state-of-the-art approaches were selected as baselines for navigation inunknown environments: (i) FastPlanner (ii) Reactive

The experiments was performed in theFlightmare simulator using the RotorS Gazebo plugin foraccurate physics modeling and Unity as a rendering engine. Theexperiments are conducted in four different environments as shown in the figure \ref{fig:stimulated envt}.

The drone is provided with the following: the state of theplatform, depth measurements from the stereo camera, and a goal inthe form of a reference state that lies 5 s in the future.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Natural environment}
Traditional mapping and planning approaches generally fail to achieve high speeds in such conditions, asboth the thick vegetation and the texture-less snow terrain often causevery noisy depth observations. At average speeds of 3 and 5 $m/s$ our approach consistently completed the task without experiencing a single crash. 
The state-of-the-art methods achieve in similar environments a maximum averagespeed of 2.29 $m/s$.

Despite the very high-speed of 5 to 7 $m/s$, the model successfully themaneuvered 8 out of 10 experiments. Thetwo failures happened when objects entered the field of view very latebecause of the high angular velocity of the platform. At higher speed of 10 $m/s$, external disturbances, e.g. aerodynamics, battery power drops, and motion-blur start to play an important roleand widen the simulation to reality gap. 
The results are summarized in the figure \ref{fig:natual-human-result}.

\subsection{Human-made environments}
A total of 19 experiments was performed with flight speeds inthe range of 3 to 7 $m/s$. Given the lower success rate experiencedin the forest environment at 10 $m/s$, test at higher speeds was not conducted to avoid fatal crashes. The results are summarized in the figure \ref{fig:natual-human-result}.

\textbf{Narrow gap test}\\
The commercialdrone, flying at a speed of about 2.7 $m/s$ consistently failed to passthrough the gap across three experiments. On the other hand, the proposed model successfullyflew through the narrow gap every time. A total of six experiments at flight speeds of 3 and 5 $m/s$ were conducted and the drone never experienced acrash.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Controlled experiments}
Atlow speeds (3 $m/s$ ) all methods perform similarly. However, as thespeed increases, the baselines’ performances quickly drop: already at5 $m/s$ , no baseline is able to complete all runs without crashing. Incontrast, the proposed method can reliably fly at high-speeds through all environments, achieving an average success rate of 70 percent at 10 $m/s$ as shown in the figure \ref{fig:stimulated-results}. Thedrop in performance of the two baselines can be justified as follows.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Although the reactive baseline has a low processing latency, yet it has a limited expressive power: the trajectory to be executed can only be selected from a relatively small set of primitives. In addition, being the reactive baseline only conditioned on the current observation, it is strongly affected by noise in the observation.
	\item The FastPlanner baseline can reject outliersin the depth map by leveraging multiple observations, which makes itmore robust to sensing errors. However, this methods generally results in higher processing latency: Multiple observations are required to addobstacles in the map, and, therefore, to plan trajectories to avoid them.This problem is worsened by high-speed motion, which generally results in little overlap between consecutive observations.
\end{itemize}

\section{Computational cost}

All timings were recorded on a desktop computerwith a 6-core i7-8700 central processing unit (CPU), which was alsoused to run the simulation experiments. The timing are reported when using only the CPU for all approaches.We also report the timings of our approach when performing neuralnetwork inference on a GeForce RTX 2080 graphics processing unit(GPU). We additionallyevaluate the timing of our algorithm on the onboard computer of thequadrotor which is a Jetson TX2.

Table \ref{tab:processing-latency} shows the results of comparison of computational cost of our algorithm
with the baselines. It highlights how each step of the methods contributes to the overallprocessing latency.

\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1}

With a total computation time of 65.2 ms per frame, FastPlanner incurs the highest processing latency. Thetemporal filtering operations that are necessary to cope with sensing errors effectively make perception even slower. Two to three observations
of an obstacle can be required to add it to the map, which increasesthe effective latency of the system. 

By foregoing the mapping stagealtogether, the Reactive baseline significantly reduces computationtime with a total processing latency of 19.1 ms. However, the reduced processinglatency comes at the cost of the trajectory complexity that can be represented. In addition, the reactive baseline is sensitive to sensing errors,which can drastically affect performance at high speeds. 

The proposed approach has significantly lower processing latency than bothbaselines; when network inference is performed on the GPU, the model is 25.3 times faster than FastPlanner and 7.4 times fasterthan the Reactive baseline. When GPU inference is disabled, thenetwork’s latency increases by only 8 ms. Moving from the desktop computer
to the onboard embedded computing device, the network’s forwardpass requires 38.9 ms. Onboard, the total time to pass from the sensorreading to a plan is 41.6 ms, which corresponds to an update rate of about 24 Hz.



\section{Effect of latency and sensor noise}
In this experiment, the quadrotor travels along astraight line at a constant forward speed and is required to laterallyevade a single obstacle (a pole) while having only limited sensingrange. 

Upper-bound for the forward speed at which a robot canfly and avoid a single obstacle as a function of perception latency andsensing range is given by
\begin{equation}
	v_{max} = \frac{s}{t_s + t_p + t_{rot} + \sqrt{\frac{2*r_{obs}}{sin(\theta)*c_{max}}}}
\end{equation}

Where
\begin{itemize}
	\item $s$ : Sensing range
	\item $r_{obs}$ : The combined radius of the obstacle and the drone
	\item $t_s$ : The sensing latency,
	\item $t_p$ : The processinglatency (the time to convert an observation into motor commands)
	\item $t_{rot}$ : The latency introduced to reorient the platform
	\item $\theta$ : The desired roll angle
	\item $c_{max}$ : The maximum mass-normalized thrust of the platform
\end{itemize}

Themaximum speed depends on the sensing range, i.e. how far can anobstacle be accurately perceived, the latency of the visual sensor, i.e.the inverse of the frame rate, and the processing latency, i.e. the timeto convert an observation into motor commands. 

The experiment is set up by placing a quadrotor with an initial
forward velocity $v$ at a distance of $6 m$ from a pole with diameter $1.5 m$.
The quadrotor is modeled as a sphere with radius $0.2 m$. We then perform the controlled experiment with varyingforward speeds $v$ in the range of 3 to $13 m/s$.

We perform 10experiments for each speed with all approaches and report the success
rate. We run the experiment in two settings: (i) with ground-truth depth
nformation, to isolate the effect of latency on performance, and (ii)
with depth estimated by stereo matching (see fig \ref{fig:sterio-vision}) to analyze the effect of
sensing errors to performance.The results are summarized in the figure \ref{fig:noise-graph}.

\subsection{Ground-truth depth}

All approaches can complete thetask perfectly up to 5$m/s$ . However, even in these ideal conditions,the performance of the baselines drops for speeds beyond 5$m/s$ . Thisdrop in performance for Reactive is because thefinite library of motion primitives does not contain maneuvers that are aggressive enough to complete this task. Similarly, the performancedegrades for FastPlanner as a result of sub-optimal planning of actions.

Our approach can successfully avoid the obstacle without asingle failure up to 7 $m/s$. For higher speeds, performance gracefully degrades to 60 percent at 10 $m/s$. This decrease in performance canbe attributed to the sensitivity to imperfect network predictions whenflying at high speed, where a single wrong action can lead to a crash.

\subsection{Estimated depth}
The same experiment is repeated to study the influence of imperfect sensory measurements on performance. In this experiment, we provide all methods with depth maps that have been computed fromthe stereo pairs.  

The baselines experience a significant drop in performancecompared with when provided with perfect sensory readings. FastPlanner completely fails for speeds of 5 $m/s$ and beyond. This sharpdrop in performance is because of the need for additional filtering of the noisy depth measurements.Similarly, the performance of the Reactive baselinedrops by 30 percent at 7 $m/s$.

Our approachis only marginally affected by the noisy depth readings, with only a
10 percent drop in performance at 10 $m/s$, but no change in performance atlower speeds. This is because our policy, trained on depth from stereo,learns to account for common issues in the data such as discretizationartifacts and missing values.

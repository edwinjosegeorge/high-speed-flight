A project Report/Seminar report is a documentation of a student's research
work.
It provides information on the student's work to the future students.
Institute-wide
standardization, readability, conformance to ethical norms, and durability are the four
overriding criteria for an acceptable form of a report.


The Chapter titles in this document are not part of the seminar report and were arbitrarily chosen.
